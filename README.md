Visit this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZAubwmyWarU33zYq42n2C6wNyTUj4JejcqoXDK75evc/edit?usp=sharing) to learn about my project. This project uses the Gabor filter to show tree cover. The Gabor filter is a combination of the Gaussian filter and Sinosudal filter and here it used to detect texture gradients, which separates trees from grass, since texture is a primary difference between tree and grass pixels. Tree and grass pixels can be separated from all other pixels with a green color mask. This process allows accurate calcuation of canopy cover, which is an important environmental metric.
